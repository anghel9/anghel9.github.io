                    Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language made for working with data, mainly in relational database systems. It's especially useful for handling structured data, where information is organized into relationships between entities and variables.
                    Created in the 1970s, SQL improved on older systems by letting users retrieve many records with a single command and by removing the need to specify exactly how to find a record. It is based on relational algebra and calculus, 
                    and its commands are often grouped into sublanguages: DQL (querying data), DDL (defining data), DML (modifying data), and DCL (controlling access).
                    SQL can query data, insert and update records, define database structures, and manage permissions. While it is mainly declarative, meaning you state what you want rather than how to do it, it also includes some procedural features.
                    SQL was one of the first commercial languages to use Edgar F. Codd's relational model, introduced in 1970, though it doesn't fully match the model as Codd described. Even so, it became the most widely used database language.
                    It was standardized by ANSI in 1986 and ISO in 1987, with updates over time to add features. However, no database system follows the standard completely so SQL code needs adjustments to work across different platforms. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank">source</a>
