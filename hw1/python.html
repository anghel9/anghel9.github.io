                    Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed to be easy to read, using indentation as part of its structure.
                    It uses dynamic typing, has automatic memory management (garbage collection), and supports different programming styles such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
                    Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s as a follow-up to the ABC language. A major update, Python 3.0, came out in 2008 and wasn't fully backward-compatible with earlier versions. 
                    Newer releases, like Python 3.12, have added features to improve typing and performance. Only Python 3.x versions are currently supported.
                    Today, Python is one of the most popular programming languages. It's especially common in machine learning and is widely used as an introductory language in education. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)" target="_blank">source</a>
